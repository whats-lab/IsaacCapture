"""
Keyboard Source Node - in-process keyboard device for the retargeting engine.

Keys reach Isaac Teleop from whatever surface the user has focused (a native window, a
browser tab, ...) through :class:`KeyboardProvider` objects on the source's
``KeyboardTracker``. The tracker merges every provider, records to MCAP like any DeviceIO
device, and this node converts each frame to two bitmaps indexed by evdev key code
(:class:`EvdevKeyCode`), one entry per Linux key code (``KEYBOARD_KEY_CODE_COUNT``). Carries no semantic mapping: which keys mean what is up to the
consuming retargeter.

Hosts either drive a provider directly (``create_provider``) or hand the source any object
implementing :class:`KeyEventSource` (``attach``).

    Implemented by the host (a window, a browser viewer, ...) without importing Isaac Teleop
    types. Requirements:

    - Call ``on_key(code, pressed)`` for press and release only while the surface has focus;
      ``code`` is a W3C ``KeyboardEvent.code`` string ("KeyW", "ArrowUp", ...) or an evdev int.
      Autorepeat may be forwarded; repeated presses of a held key are ignored.
    - Call ``on_focus_lost()`` on blur, close or disconnect so no key can stay stuck.
    - When the host can tell that its own UI owns the keyboard, that UI wins: don't forward keys
      typed into its text fields, and call ``on_focus_lost()`` the moment its UI takes the
      keyboard (a text field gains focus), exactly as on blur -- otherwise a key held at that
      moment never sees its release. A host that cannot tell reports those keys too, and should
      document it.
    - ``capture_keyboard`` yields only host shortcuts that conflict with teleop (camera keys,
      hotkeys); it never blocks the host's text input. Each call returns its own handle, and the
      shortcuts stay yielded while any handle is open. A call that raises must leave the host
      unchanged.
    - A surface that cannot report releases (press-only hotkeys, a plain terminal) reports each
      keystroke as ``on_key(code, True)`` immediately followed by ``on_key(code, False)``: a
      tap that reaches ``keyboard_pressed`` but is never held.
    - Callbacks may arrive on any thread, but one subscription's callbacks must run one at a
      time, in the order the events happened: a key event from before a focus loss completes
      before ``on_focus_lost()`` runs, never after it. A press delivered late stays held, and
      the consumer cannot tell it apart from a real one.
